## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Option A: Local Development (Manual Tomcat)
1. **Prerequisites**: Java Development Kit (JDK) 17, Apache Tomcat 9.0, MySQL Server.
2. **Database Setup**: Create a local schema named `gamudalk` and import the table structures from `db/gamudalk.sql` in this repository.
3. Configure these environment variables for database credentials:
   * `DB_URL`: `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/gamudalk?characterEncoding=utf8`
   * `DB_USER`: Your MySQL username (defaults to `root`)
   * `DB_PASSWORD`: Your MySQL password
4. Run the project in Eclipse or your preferred IDE using **Run on Server** pointing to Tomcat 9.

### Option B: Local Development (Docker Compose)
If you have **Docker Desktop** installed, run the entire app and connect to a local database with one command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Option C: AWS Production Deployment (Docker + Jenkins CI/CD)
To set up your database in **AWS RDS**, launch a host in **AWS EC2**, install Docker, configure Jenkins pipelines, and set up continuous integration, please follow our comprehensive step-by-step guide:
